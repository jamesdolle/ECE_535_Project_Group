 James Dolle, Bryan Leung, Allen Molekunnel
</h1>
 
## Project Proposal and Motivation:  
Bryan Leung, James Dolle, and Allen Molekunnel are going to be partners for Project 6. 
We all are undergraduate computer engineering students and have a good background in data structures, programming, and computer architecture.
We have developed a basic understanding and interest for Machine Learning through class lectures and research papers we have read to date.
We would like to continue to learn more by researching machine learning topics and how to use machine learning in our own applications. 
All of us have a background in programming. While Bryan and Allen have a strong background in Python, James has a strong background in C/C++ and Java.
With our combined skills, we are confident in being suitable candidates for the completion of the project. Through our research in the topic that we have chosen, 
we aim to better understand federated learning, its different techniques, and the variations in accuracy when using the different techniques.

## Design Goals and Deliverables:
• Through the design and development of the data and code provided to us, our goal is to understand and implement different 
FL techniques – Federated averaging (FedAvg) and Agnostic FL  
• Utilize diverse datasets for training and assessment of two FL techniques  
• Examine the enhancement in the variance of accuracy among individual client groups when
employing various federated learning techniques.

## Team Roles:  setup, software, networking, writing, research, algorithm design
**James:** Software, Writing, Networking, Research  
**Bryan:** Software, Writing, Algorithm design, Setup  
**Allen:** Setup, Software, Research, Algorithm Design  

## Project Timeline:

In The begining of october we will meet up and figure out the steps required to complete the project.
Here we will go to the TA office hours with any quetions about the project. During this phase we will
find out how much work is required and how many "assignments" we will need to set up.

End of each month we will regroup to see where we are at, and what we need to get done for the following month.
Atleast twice a month we will meet up.

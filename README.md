Project Proposal

Project 5 Proposal:
Bryan Leung and James Dolle are going to be partners for Project 5. 
We are both Computer Engineers, so we both have a moderate background in data structures, programming, and computer architecture.
We have developed a basic understanding of Machine Learning through class lectures and research papers we have read to date.
We will continue to learn more as well by researching machine learning topics and how to use machine learning in our own applications. 
Both James and Bryan have a background in programming. While Bryan has a strong background in Python, James has a strong background in C/C++ and Java.
With our combined skills, we are confident in being suitable candidates for the completion of Project 5.

Team Roles:  setup, software, networking, writing, research, algorithm design
James: Software, Writing, Networking, Researching,
Bryan: Software, Writing, Algorithm design, Setup

Time Frame:

In The begining of october we will meet up and figure out the steps required to complete the project.
Here we will go to the TA office hours with any quetions about the project. During this phase we will
find out how much work is required and how many "assignments" we will need to set up.

End of each month we will regroup to see where we are at, and what we need to get done for the following month.
Atleast twice a month we will meet up.

Design Goals:

Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting.
    Learn about how federated learning approach work and how to apply.
    Successfully train a machine learning model where we also keep user privacy as a concern.
    Learn how about benchmarking standards and how to apply to machinbe learning.

Deliverables(from class project powerpoint):

Understand multimodal federated learning (code:https://github.com/yuchenzhao/iotdi22-mmfl)
• Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper
• data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rWJYkfMavGs1F-H0jykJ5V0fIiwrQdJV
• Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy
• Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution

Project Proposal

Project 5
Bryan Wleung and James Dolle are going to be partners for Project 5. 
We are both Computer Engineers, so we both have a moderate background in data structures, programming, and computer architecture.
We have developed a basic understanding of Machine Learning through class lectures and research papers we have read to date.
We will continue to learn more as well by researching machine learning topics and how to use machine learning in our own applications. 
Both James and Bryan have a background in programming. While Bryan has a strong background in Python, James has a strong background in C/C++ and Java.
With our combined skills, we are confident in being suitable candidates for the completion of Project 5.
